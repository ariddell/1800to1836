Sources for Scans
=================

Sources and example searches for a novel with "Clugny" in the title (I think
the original was "The Abby of Clugny", a gothic novel).

* Internet Archive / Open Content Alliance

  Use title:() and date:[] constraints.

  title:(clugny) AND date:[1739-01-01 TO 1900-01-01]

* Google Books / Hathi Trust

  Use "Advanced Book Search" http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search

  Use the intitle: constraint and the date: constraint. For example: http://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=intitle:Clugny+date:1700-1900&as_pt=ALLTYPES&as_brr=3

* Worldcat / OCLC

  Scans available at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek show up with this search.

* Stanford Literary Lab Collection

  Easy to search. Use the secret URL.

* Literature Online / Chadwyck-Healey

  Easy to search.

* Silver Fork bibliography and scans

  99 novels published between 1814 and 1843, matched with scans.

NB: The Garside et al. bibliographies have information about library
holdings in the event that a scan cannot be found.

Searching Tips
==============

* Seems best to search by a characteristic word in the title and date.

* Remember to look for second editions or printings even if the first edition
  is absent.
